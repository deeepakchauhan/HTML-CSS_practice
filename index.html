         <p id="two">ere on Earth, the principal originator 
            of computers was the English mathematician Alan Turing. In his paper, published
             in 1936Alan M. Turing,
             On Computable Numbers,
             with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (1936)., Turing wasn’t trying 
             to invent a clever gadget or to create 
             an 
             industry. Rather, he was attacking a problem about the nature of mathematics posed by the German ma
             thematician David Hilbe
             rt in 1928. That sounds abstruse, but it’s worth understanding the gist of Hilbert and Turing’s thinking, 
             since it illumina
             tes where computers come from, and what computers will become in the future</p>
